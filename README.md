# Project Description
Z coins tries to solve all the above mentioned problems. Instead of putting your money in the bank, if you put them in the Z coins app/website, you can expect returns on the money you have invested without having to worry about what shares to invest in or about the amount of money required to invest in the first place. The money pooled up through this platform will be invested in the stock market using Algorithmic Trading and the returns will be shared proportionally. Although each customer might maintain less cash in their wallet, with a considerable number of people using the product, we can expect good results. We will invest in a wide basket of stocks which makes the product less susceptible to losses. Even if one company’s shares fall down or don’t act the way we expect, there wouldn’t be much loss due to the diversity of the portfolio. The money in the wallet is used to buy Z-coins. Z-coin value would be determined by the market conditions but the price will be a smaller amount like ₹100. This would be a good way to start investing for someone who is risk averse. If the user believes that the stock market can be a place where he can earn a decent income, that would motivate him to dig deep into it. For users who don’t know how to analyze the stock market, we would be investing on their behalf. They can invest in the market without knowing the technical details. The users would not be knowing which stocks we are investing in. So they won’t keep checking the statistics. People who don’t have time to monitor their investments can use this product to save time and invest at the same time. People who don’t think they have enough money to invest in the stock market can start investing in small amounts using this app. Due to pooling of money, we don’t need a single person to buy a complete stock. Finally, instead of keeping a small amount of money in the bank for meager interest, they can put their money in Z coins and hope for better results.
For example: a person has 1000 rs and wants to invest it in the stock market but the value of stock itself is 3000rs, he might be able to do it. Since this product works on money pooled from a lot of people, we can invest on their behalf and distribute the profits. Withdrawal: Procedure for withdrawal depends on the time the user requests for a withdrawal. 5:30 PM - 9:00 AM : The person has to wait till 9:00 AM to withdraw his money. 9:00 AM- 5:30 PM : The person has to wait till 5:30 PM to withdraw his money. Although this seems restrictive, it is far more convenient than Fixed deposits and mutual funds where you can not withdraw your investment incase of emergency without penalty. Transactions:
The user need not withdraw cash inorder to buy something. The user can buy goods and services using Z-coins, provided the service provider also has a Z-coin wallet. Here it has to be noted that the profit/loss will also be given to the receiver of the coin. So in short, the Z-coin is being transferred from one person to another instead of money.
<br/>
## Request/Accept Coins: 
The person can request & accept Z-coins from any other Z-coin user using the other person’s mobile number.
