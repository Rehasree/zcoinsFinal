# Use of Fusion APIs in the project

## Account Holder creation
We  used the Account Holder creation API during the singup process when the user first enters the website. It creates a unique identification ID for the user. 

## Account Creation
Once the Account Holder is created during the signup, his account will be created using the account creation API. 

## Payments API

### Fund Transfers API
We use the funds API to transfer Z-coins from one user to another. When a user enters the mobile number of another user and sends him some coins, this API will be used.
