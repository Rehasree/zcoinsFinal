# Algorithmic Trading

pyAlgotrade.py implements an algorithm which takes in a CSV file (AAPL.csv) containing the details of stock market prices and predicts if we should by the stock or sell it if we have it. The program is inspired from the [pyAlgoTrade librarie's demo](http://gbeced.github.io/pyalgotrade/docs/v0.20/html/tutorial.html). 

Currently, the program is very simple but the final plan is to implement an algorithm capable of predicting stock market prices accurately using Deep learning. It would do the trading autonomously once it's accuracy is proven.
